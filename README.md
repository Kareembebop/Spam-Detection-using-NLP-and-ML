# Spam-Detection-using-NLP-and-ML
This project implements a Spam Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It takes SMS messages, cleans and preprocesses them (removing stopwords, stemming, and lowercasing), converts them into numerical features using TF-IDF, and trains a machine learning classifier to detect whether a message is spam or ham.
